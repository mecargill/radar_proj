You can find a description of this radar project on https://mecargill.github.io/portfolio_page/.

Mcu_fmcw_manager is code for an STM32 f446. It buffers data from the ADC and sends it over SPI to the master (a raspberry pi in my case).
It also sends a triangle wave to the DAC.

Fmcw_pcb contains the KiCAD project in which I made the schematic and PCB for the radar.
